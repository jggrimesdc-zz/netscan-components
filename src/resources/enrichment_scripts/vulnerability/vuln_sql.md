# Use NoSQL for Vulnerability data

## Problem

There is a requirement to ingest Vulnerability data into a SQL based database. The listed vulnerability source includes
nested JSON, with no guarentee of schema stability. This combination is fragile, as any change to the provided JSON
could have serious raifications to the relational DB schema.

## Proposed Solution

Amend requirement to load Vulnerability into a NoSQL database (such as DynamoDB).

## Benefits

- **Query simplicity**: Data consumers would be able to read vulnerability data as-is.
- **Extensibility**: Ingesting additional data sources with new JSON schemas would induce no additional
  architecture/schema changes.
- **Time to delivery**: Using NoSQL for this source would enable faster product delivery, accelerating other activities
  in the SOW.

## Costs

- **Scope change**: This is a change in scope from the original SOW.
